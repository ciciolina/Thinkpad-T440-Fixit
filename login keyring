When you install chromium or chrome in your linux and opened a window jumps saying to enter the passw to unlock login keyring, 
you can fix this without enter anything just go to:

/usr/share/applications/Chromium.desktop

open with sublime or nano and find this line:

Exec=/usr/bin/chromium %U

change it to this:
Exec=/usr/bin/chromium --password-store=basic %U

save and close!
