If you love flameshot (screenshot app), you will find you dont have a native config option to activate the app from Imp Pt key.
Here you will find how to do it:

Open System Settings
Open Keyboard Settings (under Hardware)
Select the 'Shortcuts' tab
Under Categories open System > Screenshots and Recordings
Check to which action the 'prtscr' key is bound (likely to Take a screenshot of an area or Take a screenshot... I had messed with this setting before, so I'm not quite sure)
Open Custom Shortcuts
Click Add custom shortcut
Type 'Flameshot' in the Name field and 'flameshot gui' in the Command field (both without the enclosing apostrophies)
Click Add
Profit
