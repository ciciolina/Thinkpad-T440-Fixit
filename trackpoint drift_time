This is the most anoying and hard to find actual info issue, here yo will find how to solve!

If your trackpoint (yes the red nipple in your keyboard), moves alone one pixel at time when you released i can tell you its a problem you can fix easy, ppal are two ways

Why this happen?
its fault of the "drift time" variable, which controls the time needed for it to recalibrate, the default is 5 seconds.
Since kernel 3.19, there's a drift_time parameter you can try changing. It defaults to 5 (times 107ms), you need more ms to fix it.

first:
- you can edit the file and change the values but when you reboot you lose this mod and need to do it again.
second:
- you can do a udev rule to change automatic this value when you start the system!!!

The first way:
$sudo -s
$echo 25 | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio1/serio2/drift_time

The second and BEST way:
echo  'ACTION=="add",SUBSYSTEM=="input",ATTR{name}=="TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint",ATTR{device/drift_time}="25"'  > /etc/udev/rules.d/10-trackpoint.rules

or create manually the file:
/etc/udev/rules.d/10-trackpoint.rules

and add this line:
ACTION=="add",SUBSYSTEM=="input",ATTR{name}=="TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint",ATTR{device/drift_time}="25"

and save file!

Now yout trackpoint was exorciced and dont move alone! 25/30 are the values i test and works perfect!
With the udev rules you can change any parameter from boot and its persistent.
