after install timeshift and run the wizard config, you can notice the sheduled snapshots doesnt works, this is because the cron service its not enabled,
you need to enable and verify it to fix this issue with timeshift, this lines make cronie persistent and run after reboot.

$sudo -s
#systemctl enable cronie.service
#systemctl start cronie.service

you can verify this service its running with this:
#systemctl status cronie.service

or this (recomended):
journalctl -b -u cronie

now its working, time to surf the internet!
