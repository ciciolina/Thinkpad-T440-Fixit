Flat Design themes for Grub2
https://github.com/vinceliuice/grub2-themes

If you install this theme you will find some images are wrong or non-show for this reason you need to rename the image files to fix it.
After many try's i can do it and here you will find my mod version, you only need to re-write the files.

You maybe need install grub costumizer from AUR to admin your themes.
