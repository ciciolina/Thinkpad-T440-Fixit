I found this issue after install the application and run a video from youtube, 
my CPU consume more power and the temp jumps from 44-50c to 66-69c, 
im pretty sure its the resolution of the video and after look 
straw-viewer --tricks i found the config file: /home/c/.config/straw-viewer/straw-viewer.conf 
make a $sudo nano and search for the resolution line and found it resolution => "best", 
after change "best" to "720px" and save the change my CPU and temp issue was solved.
Also setting hfr => 0, will help with slow GPUs when resolution is set to 1080p or higher.
