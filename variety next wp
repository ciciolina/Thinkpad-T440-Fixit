After search an option to make a shortcut for variety i found the command that works!!!
go to shortcut and put this command and link it to your favorite keys combination and put this:
variety -n

Voila! now you have a working shortcut to the wallpaper, i think you can use -p to change to the preview wallpaper, you can try too...
