This is the most time consuming think to do but with this guide you can solve it.

first install thinkfan from AUR

configure kernel module
sudo echo "options thinkpad_acpi fan_control=1" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/thinkfan.conf
sudo modprobe -rv thinkpad_acpi
sudo modprobe -v thinkpad_acpi

reload kernel module
modprobe thinkpad_acpi

write my config in /etc/thinkpad.conf

# I use this on my T61p:
tp_fan /proc/acpi/ibm/fan
tp_thermal /proc/acpi/ibm/thermal (0, 10, 15, 2, 10, 5, 0, 3)

#tp_fan /proc/acpi/ibm/fan
#hwmon /sys/devices/platform/coretemp.0/hwmon/hwmon2/temp3_input
#hwmon /sys/devices/platform/thinkpad_hwmon/hwmon/hwmon4/temp1_input
#hwmon /sys/devices/platform/thinkpad_hwmon/hwmon/hwmon4/temp2_input
#hwmon /sys/devices/virtual/hwmon/hwmon0/temp1_input

Enable and start the service so it will be started automatically at every boot and drop privileges.
root$ systemctl enable thinkfan
root$ systemctl start thinkfan

After reboot, check the service
systemctl status thinkfan.service

After many try's i found this config works fine (silence fan and good temp) on my T440
