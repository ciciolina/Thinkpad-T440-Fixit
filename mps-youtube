if you install mps-youtube you will find sometimes the app stop with a message of cache error or key error, you can fix it manually run this: 

$rm ~/.config/mps-youtube/cache_py_*

but i find this anoying and time waste for that reason i create a command you can put in your bash, always when you open terminal to run "mpsyt" the file its 
deleted without intervention of the user, secure (yes more secure than use rm) and work always!

you need to put this line on your bash file:

find /home/c/.config/mps-youtube -type f -regextype posix-extended -iregex '.*\.(.?)$' -delete

This baby search and found the cache file and delete, with this you will run mpsyt always without problems!

how this works?
the cache file of mpsyt its the unique file without a extencion .* this line found this file and delete in a secure form.
